# soda-machine-challenge-first-command

Objective 

Using any object-oriented programming language and object-oriented design, your assignment  is to implement a “soda machine” such that as an end-user, I can put money into the machine,  select a product, and have the machine dispense my product and change. 

Tasks 

Implement assignment using: 
• Any object-oriented programming language 
• Object-oriented design 
• Bonus: Use exceptions 
• Bonus: Unit tests 

The soda machine should be able to: 
Accept Coins 
    GIVEN: A soda machine
    WHEN: I insert some coins 
    THEN: My balance on the machine is updated 

Select Products 
    GIVEN: A soda machine 
    WHEN: I select a product 
    THEN: The machine checks if I can purchase the product with my balance AND THEN: The machine dispenses my product 

Make Change 
    GIVEN: A soda machine 
    WHEN: I select a product 
    THEN: The machine checks if I can purchase the product with my balance AND THEN: The machine deducts the cost of the product from my balance and  dispenses the correct amount of change 
Sold Out 
    GIVEN: A soda machine 
    WHEN: I select a sold-out product 
    THEN: The machine tells me that product is sold out 
    
Remember 
This assignment does not require any fancy user interfaces, print statements will work. We are  looking for solid code design that can showcase object-oriented design. Good luck!
